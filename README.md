# Hidden-Markow-Models-Python-Implementation
This repository shows how to implement HMM for CPSC-340 course, Machine Learning and Data Minig homework.
The associated homework can be found in here:

#Runnig the test
Parameters:
```
px0 = prior knowled
theta = transition probability
phi= observation probability
y = observations
T = iterations
```
Run

```
HMM(px0 = px0, theta=theta, phi=phi, y= y, T=t)
```
